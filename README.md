# SnakesGame
A simple snake game made in Python!

This is one of my first projects using python and I did recieve a lot of extrenal help on the code from multiple websites.

Line 2 (import time) is not used and can be removed without causing issues with the game! The original idea was to add the amount of time the player survived but I decided a score for food eaten was a better option.

Future Improvements
I would like to have this game function within a Discord channel.
Once it is functional within Discord I would like to add a leaderboard so it can be competitive between friends
